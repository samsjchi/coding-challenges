Description:
Write a function – spyOn – which takes in another function as an argument. spyOn should
return a spy (i.e. a function) that can be invoked and behaves like the original function.
However, the spy has some extra capabilities in addition to behaving like the original function.

Please read the requirements carefully!

The spy (i.e. the returned function) should also have these methods:
  - .callCount() which returns the number of times the spy was invoked.
  - .wasCalledWith(arg) which returns a boolean representing whether the supplied ‘arg’ was used in a previous invocation of spy. When a spy is invoked with multiple arguments, each argument supplied should be stored such that .wasCalledWith() will return true for each individual argument.
  - .returned(val) which returns a boolean representing whether the spy was invoked and returned the supplied ‘val’.

Read the test cases to double check the use-cases.

function spyOn(fn) {
  let count = 0, args = [], returned = [];

  let spy = function() {
    count++;
    let value = fn(...arguments);
    args.push(...arguments);
    returned.push(value);
    return value;
  };

  spy.callCount = () => count;
  spy.wasCalledWith = arg => !!~args.indexOf(arg);
  spy.returned = val => !!~returned.indexOf(val);

  return spy;
};
