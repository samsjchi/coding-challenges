Name: Find Person

Link: https://challenge.makerpass.com/c/b7556a01049bae7a5004d227e5b67d8b

Description:
Given a name (string) and an array of people (objects), find the person with the given name and return his/her hobby. Return false if there is no person with the given name.

DO NOT use people.find()

DO use a for loop.

TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after youâ€™ve solved it using a for loop.

Examples:
  Input                          |  Output
-------------------------------------------------------------------
  name: "Alice"                  |  "programming"
  people:                        |
  [ { "name": "Alice",           |
      "hobby": "programming" },  |
    { "name": "Bob",             |
      "hobby": "gaming" } ]      |
*/

const findPerson = (name, people) => {
  for(let i = 0; i < people.length; i++) {
    if(people[i].name === name) return people[i].hobby;
  }
  return false;
}
